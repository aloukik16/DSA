## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are crucial for efficient problem-solving and software development. This repository is dedicated to practicing and mastering these concepts through a variety of problems. Each solution is thoughtfully crafted, with comments and explanations to enhance understanding.

## Scope of Repository

In this repository, I will be covering:

- **Basic Java**: From variables, data types, and control structures to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**:
  - **Basic Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, and basic recursion.
  - **Advanced Topics**: Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms, Greedy Algorithms, and more.

## Problems Covered

This repository includes a variety of problems from different categories:

- **Arrays**: Basics, searching, sorting, and manipulation.
- **Linked Lists**: Single, double, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementation and common problems.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.
- **Graphs**: Graph traversal, shortest path, and other algorithms.
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**: Bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort, binary search, etc.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, and more.

## Language Used

I am primarily using **Java** for solving all the DSA problems in this repository.
